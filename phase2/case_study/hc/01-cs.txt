`Mini Hackathon Theme: "Hospital Management System in C++"`

`Overview:`
Participants will create a `Hospital Management System` in C++ that allows for the management of patient records, doctor assignments, scheduling appointments, and tracking medical history. The system will focus on `object-oriented programming (OOP)` concepts, `file handling`, and `data management` techniques in C++.

---

`Hackathon Structure:`

`1. Problem Statement:`
Create a `Hospital Management System` that manages and processes the following:
- `Patient Management`: Allows adding, viewing, and updating patient records.
- `Doctor Management`: Allows adding, viewing, and managing doctor details.
- `Appointment Scheduling`: Allows patients to book and cancel appointments with doctors.
- `Medical History`: Allows doctors to add medical history notes for each patient.
- `File Persistence`: Store all patient, doctor, and appointment data in text files so that the data persists between sessions.

---

`2. Requirements:`

1. `Core Features`:
   - `Patient Management`:
     - Add, view, and update patient details (e.g., name, age, contact information, medical history).
   - `Doctor Management`:
     - Add, view, and update doctor details (e.g., name, specialization, contact information).
   - `Appointment Management`:
     - Patients can book appointments with doctors.
     - Doctors can view their scheduled appointments.
     - Patients can cancel appointments.
   - `Medical History`:
     - Doctors can add medical history notes for a patient.
     - Medical history should be associated with each patient.
   - `File Handling`:
     - Store patient, doctor, appointment, and medical history details in text files.

2. `Advanced Features (Bonus)`:
   - `Search Functionality`: Allow searching for patients by name, doctor by specialization, or appointment by date.
   - `Scheduling Conflicts`: Prevent double-booking of doctors (ensure appointments do not overlap).
   - `Reporting`: Generate a report for daily or weekly appointments for each doctor.

---

`3. Tools and Technologies:`
- `Language`: `C++`
- `Compiler`: GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
- `Libraries`: Standard Template Library (STL) for data handling like vectors, maps, etc.
- `File Handling`: Use file I/O for storing and retrieving patient, doctor, and appointment data from text files.

---

`4. Expected Deliverables:`
1. `Working Application`:
   - A fully functional C++ application with a simple, menu-driven interface for managing patients, doctors, and appointments.
2. `Data Files`:
   - Text files for storing patients, doctors, appointments, and medical history data:
     - `patients.txt`
     - `doctors.txt`
     - `appointments.txt`
     - `medical_history.txt`
3. `Documentation`:
   - A brief explanation of the program's functionality, structure, and usage.
   - Instructions on how to compile and run the program.

---

`5. Evaluation Criteria:`
1. `Functionality`:
   - Does the system allow the user to manage patient records, doctor details, and appointments as required?
2. `Code Quality`:
   - Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented? Is it easy to understand and extend?
3. `OOP Principles`:
   - Is the program structured using proper object-oriented design principles, such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation?
4. `Innovation`:
   - Are there any additional or advanced features like reporting, search, or conflict resolution?
5. `User Experience`:
   - How intuitive and user-friendly is the interface?

---

`6. Duration:`
- `6â€“8 Hours` (ideal for a one-day hackathon).

---

`Sample Workflow:`
1. `Main Menu`:
   ```
   Welcome to Hospital Management System
   1. Add Patient
   2. Add Doctor
   3. Schedule Appointment
   4. View Appointments
   5. Add Medical History
   6. View Medical History
   7. Cancel Appointment
   8. Exit
   Enter your choice: 3
   ```

2. `Booking an Appointment`:
   - Enter patient details (name, age, contact information).
   - Search for available doctors based on specialization.
   - Choose a doctor and schedule an appointment with a date and time.
   - Display confirmation message.

3. `Example Output`:
   ```
   Appointment Scheduled:
   Patient: John Doe
   Doctor: Dr. Smith (Cardiology)
   Date: 2025-01-20
   Time: 11:00 AM
   ```

4. `Viewing and Updating Medical History`:
   - Doctors can view a patient's details and add medical notes to their record.

---

`Suggested Implementation Steps`:

1. `Define Classes`:
   - `Patient`:
     - Attributes: `patientID`, `name`, `age`, `contactInfo`, `medicalHistory`.
     - Methods: `addPatient()`, `viewPatientDetails()`, `updatePatientDetails()`.
   - `Doctor`:
     - Attributes: `doctorID`, `name`, `specialization`, `contactInfo`, `availability`.
     - Methods: `addDoctor()`, `viewDoctorDetails()`, `assignPatient()`.
   - `Appointment`:
     - Attributes: `appointmentID`, `patientID`, `doctorID`, `date`, `time`.
     - Methods: `scheduleAppointment()`, `cancelAppointment()`.
   - `MedicalHistory`:
     - Attributes: `patientID`, `doctorID`, `notes`, `date`.
     - Methods: `addNotes()`, `viewNotes()`.

2. `File Handling`:
   - Use text files to store data persistently:
     - `patients.txt`: Stores patient information.
     - `doctors.txt`: Stores doctor information.
     - `appointments.txt`: Stores appointment records.
     - `medical_history.txt`: Stores medical notes.

3. `Data Structures`:
   - Use `vectors` or `maps` for storing patient, doctor, and appointment records in memory.
   - Use `file I/O operations` to load and save data from/to files at the start and end of the program.

4. `Error Handling`:
   - Handle invalid inputs (e.g., invalid patient or doctor IDs).
   - Prevent double-booking by checking available slots for doctors before confirming an appointment.

5. `Additional Features`:
   - `Search Functionality`: Allow users to search for patients, doctors, and appointments based on specific attributes like ID, name, and date.
   - `Scheduling Conflicts`: Ensure that no doctor has overlapping appointments.

`Example Code Structure`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

// Patient Class
class Patient {
public:
    int patientID;
    string name;
    int age;
    string contactInfo;
    string medicalHistory;
    void addPatient();
    void viewPatientDetails();
    void updatePatientDetails();
};

// Doctor Class
class Doctor {
public:
    int doctorID;
    string name;
    string specialization;
    string contactInfo;
    bool availability;
    void addDoctor();
    void viewDoctorDetails();
};

// Appointment Class
class Appointment {
public:
    int appointmentID;
    int patientID;
    int doctorID;
    string date;
    string time;
    void scheduleAppointment();
    void cancelAppointment();
};

// MedicalHistory Class
class MedicalHistory {
public:
    int patientID;
    int doctorID;
    string notes;
    string date;
    void addNotes();
    void viewNotes();
};

// Main function
int main() {
    // Implement the menu-driven interface and the operations for managing patients, doctors, and appointments.
}
```

This hackathon will help trainee C++ programmers gain valuable hands-on experience with `object-oriented programming`, `file management`, and real-world problem-solving in the `hospital management domain`. It will also reinforce important concepts such as `data persistence`, `searching`, and `scheduling conflicts`.
