`Mini Hackathon Theme: "Smart Parking System for Connected Vehicles in C++"`

`Overview:`
Participants will develop a `Smart Parking System` using C++. The system will simulate parking space management, allowing users to check parking availability, reserve spots, and calculate charges. This project focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and algorithmic problem-solving.

---

`Hackathon Structure:`

`1. Problem Statement:`
Build a C++ application that simulates a smart parking system with the following functionalities:
- Manage a parking lot with multiple spaces.
- Allow users to check availability and reserve a parking spot.
- Calculate parking charges based on the duration of the stay.
- Store and retrieve parking lot data from a file for persistence.

---

`2. Requirements:`

1. `Core Features`:
   - `Parking Lot Management`:
     - Represent parking spaces with unique IDs.
     - Track occupied and available spots.
   - `Reservation System`:
     - Allow users to reserve a spot by entering their vehicle number.
     - Update availability in real-time.
   - `Billing`:
     - Calculate charges based on parking duration (e.g., $5/hour).
   - `File Persistence`:
     - Save parking lot data (availability, reservations, etc.) to a file.
     - Load data when the application starts.

2. `Advanced Features (Bonus)`:
   - Predict parking availability using a simple algorithm.
   - Add a command-line menu interface for better user interaction.

---

`3. Tools and Technologies:`
- Language: `C++`
- Compiler: GCC, Clang, or MSVC.
- Libraries: STL (Standard Template Library) for data handling.
- File Handling: Use standard file I/O for saving and loading data.

---

`4. Expected Deliverables:`
1. A functional C++ program with a menu-driven interface.
2. A file (`parking_lot_data.txt`) storing parking lot details.
3. Documentation explaining the code structure, classes, and usage instructions.
4. (Optional) A demo presentation or code walkthrough.

---

`5. Evaluation Criteria:`
1. `Functionality`:
   - Does the system meet the core requirements (availability, reservation, billing, file handling)?
2. `Code Quality`:
   - Is the code well-structured, readable, and efficient?
3. `OOP Concepts`:
   - Effective use of classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.
4. `Innovation`:
   - Additional features like predictive availability or advanced interfaces.
5. `Presentation`:
   - How well the solution is documented and explained.

---

`6. Duration:`
- `6â€“8 Hours` (ideal for a one-day hackathon).

---

`Sample Workflow`:
1. `Menu Options`:
   - View available parking spots.
   - Reserve a parking spot (enter vehicle details).
   - Calculate parking charges.
   - Exit and save data.

2. `Example Output`:
   ```
   Welcome to Smart Parking System
   1. View Available Parking Spots
   2. Reserve a Spot
   3. Calculate Parking Charges
   4. Exit
   Enter your choice: 1

   Available Spots:
   Spot ID: 101
   Spot ID: 102
   ...
   ```

---

`Suggested Implementation Steps:`

1. `Define Classes`:
   - `ParkingSpot`:
     - Attributes: `spotID`, `isOccupied`, `vehicleNumber`.
     - Methods: `reserveSpot()`, `releaseSpot()`.
   - `ParkingLot`:
     - Attributes: List of `ParkingSpot` objects.
     - Methods: `displayAvailableSpots()`, `calculateCharges()`.

2. `File Handling`:
   - Save `ParkingSpot` details to a file on exit.
   - Load details into memory when the application starts.

3. `Algorithms`:
   - Use a basic search to find the first available spot.
   - Calculate charges based on entry and exit times.

4. `Enhancements`:
   - Add error handling (e.g., invalid inputs).
   - Use `std::vector` or `std::map` for managing parking spots.

This hackathon will provide trainee programmers with hands-on experience in C++ programming, focusing on OOP, file handling, and practical problem-solving in the automotive domain.
