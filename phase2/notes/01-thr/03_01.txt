In C++, `std::shared_mutex` is 
a synchronization primitive 
that allows multiple threads 
to read shared data concurrently, 
but only one thread 
to write to the data at a time. 

It allows you to implement the reader-writer lock pattern where:

- Multiple threads can acquire a `shared lock` for reading, 
as long as no thread holds an exclusive lock (i.e., writing).
- Only one thread can acquire an `exclusive lock` for writing, and 
no other threads can read or write when a thread is writing.

Key Methods of `std::shared_mutex`

- `lock()` – Acquires an exclusive lock for writing. 
Blocks other threads from acquiring either shared or 
exclusive locks until released.
- `unlock()` – Releases the lock, 
allowing other threads to acquire shared or 
exclusive locks.
- `try_lock()` – Attempts to acquire the lock. 
Returns `true` if successful, 
otherwise returns `false`.
- `lock_shared()` – Acquires a shared lock for reading. 
Multiple threads can acquire shared locks simultaneously, 
but only if no thread holds an exclusive lock.
- `unlock_shared()` – Releases the shared lock.

Example Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `std::shared_mutex` 
to manage concurrent read and write access to shared data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <shared_mutex>
#include <vector>

std::shared_mutex mtx;  // Shared mutex
std::vector<int> data;  // Shared data

// Function to read data
void reader(int id) {
    std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(mtx);  // Shared lock (read)
    std::cout << "Reader " << id << " reading data: ";
    for (const auto& d : data) {
        std::cout << d << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Function to write data
void writer(int id, int value) {
    std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex> lock(mtx);  // Exclusive lock (write)
    data.push_back(value);
    std::cout << "Writer " << id << " wrote: " << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    std::thread readers[5];
    std::thread writers[2];

    // Start readers
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        readers[i] = std::thread(reader, i);
    }

    // Start writers
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        writers[i] = std::thread(writer, i, i + 100);
    }

    // Join all threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        readers[i].join();
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
        writers[i].join();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Code

- `std::shared_mutex mtx` is the shared mutex 
that synchronizes access to the `data` vector.
- `reader()` function reads the data 
while holding a shared lock 
(`std::shared_lock<std::shared_mutex>`).
- `writer()` function writes to the `data` vector 
while holding an exclusive lock 
(`std::unique_lock<std::shared_mutex>`).
- The main function creates multiple reader and writer threads and 
waits for them to finish.

Key Points:
- `Shared lock (`std::shared_lock`)`: 
Allows multiple threads 
to read simultaneously but blocks writing.
- `Exclusive lock (`std::unique_lock`)`: 
Allows a single thread to write, 
blocking both reading and writing from others 
during the write.
  
When to Use `std::shared_mutex`:
`std::shared_mutex` is ideal for situations 
where reads are much more frequent than writes, 
allowing you to improve performance 
by enabling multiple readers 
to access the shared data concurrently.
