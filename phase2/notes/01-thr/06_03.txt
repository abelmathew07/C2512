Here are several hands-on projects and exercises designed 
to help you practice and 
   solidify your understanding of multi-threading in C++. 
   
Each project progressively increases in complexity, 
covering concepts like 
  thread management, 
  synchronization, and 
  parallelism.

`Beginner Projects`

`1. Multi-threaded Prime Number Finder`
- `Goal:` Create a program that finds all prime numbers in a given range.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Divide the range into equal parts and assign each part to a separate thread.
  2. Use `std::thread` to compute primes in parallel.
  3. Combine results from all threads into a single list.
- `Concepts Covered:` 
    Thread creation, 
    joining threads, and 
    data aggregation.

`2. File Searcher`
- `Goal:` Search for a specific keyword in multiple text files.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Assign each file to a separate thread for searching.
  2. Use `std::mutex` to protect shared data like the results list.
  3. Print the filenames containing the keyword.
- `Concepts Covered:` 
    Synchronization with `std::mutex` and 
    thread-safe operations.

`3. Simple Thread Pool`
- `Goal:` Implement a basic thread pool 
    to execute a fixed number of tasks in parallel.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Use `std::thread` to create a pool of worker threads.
  2. Implement a task queue using `std::queue` and `std::mutex`.
  3. Use `std::condition_variable` for thread synchronization.
- `Concepts Covered:` 
    Thread pooling, 
    condition variables, and 
    task management.

`Intermediate Projects`

`4. Multi-threaded Matrix Multiplication`
- `Goal:` Perform matrix multiplication using multiple threads.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Assign the computation of 
    each row or block of the result matrix 
    to a separate thread.
  2. Synchronize results using shared memory.
  3. Measure and compare the performance of single-threaded vs. 
    multi-threaded implementations.

- `Goal:` Implement the producer-consumer problem using a bounded buffer.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Use `std::thread` for producers and consumers.
  2. Use `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` for synchronization.
  3. Producers generate data, and consumers process it, ensuring no race conditions occur.
- `Concepts Covered:` Synchronization, `std::condition_variable`, and bounded buffer management.

---

`6. Real-time Chat Simulator`
- `Goal:` Simulate a basic real-time chat server using multi-threading.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Create a thread for each client connection.
  2. Use `std::mutex` to protect shared chat history.
  3. Broadcast messages from one client to all others.
- `Concepts Covered:` Networking with multi-threading and shared resource management.

`Advanced Projects`

`7. Parallel Web Crawler`
- `Goal:` Develop a multi-threaded web crawler.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Use multiple threads to fetch web pages concurrently.
  2. Use `std::mutex` to manage a shared queue of URLs.
  3. Store results like page titles or keywords in a thread-safe way.
- `Concepts Covered:` Thread-safe data structures, task distribution, and scalability.

---

`8. Concurrent Logging System`
- `Goal:` Build a logging system for a multi-threaded application.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Use multiple threads to log messages from different parts of the application.
  2. Ensure thread-safe writes to a log file using `std::mutex`.
  3. Add log rotation to manage file sizes.
- `Concepts Covered:` File I/O with threads and thread-safe logging.

---

`9. Parallel Image Processing`
- `Goal:` Apply image processing filters (e.g., blur, grayscale) to large images using threads.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Divide the image into chunks and process each chunk in a separate thread.
  2. Merge the processed chunks back into a single image.
  3. Measure performance improvement over single-threaded processing.
- `Concepts Covered:` Data partitioning, thread management, and performance optimization.

---

`10. Distributed Task Queue Simulator`
- `Goal:` Simulate a distributed task queue where multiple workers process tasks.
- `Tasks:`
  1. Create worker threads that fetch tasks from a shared queue.
  2. Use `std::mutex` and `std::condition_variable` to synchronize task access.
  3. Allow dynamic task addition to the queue.
- `Concepts Covered:` Dynamic task scheduling, synchronization, and scalability.

---

`Tools and Libraries`
For these projects, you can use the following C++ libraries to aid your implementation:
- `Standard Library:` `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`, `std::atomic`.
- `Third-Party Libraries (Optional):`
  - `Boost.Thread` for advanced threading utilities.
  - `OpenMP` for parallel programming.
  - `Intel TBB (Threading Building Blocks)` for scalable task-based parallelism.

`Best Practices for Multi-threading`
- Minimize shared state to reduce contention and potential deadlocks.
- Use thread-safe data structures where possible.
- Profile and measure performance to determine the benefits of multi-threading.
- Always handle exceptions in threads to avoid crashes.
