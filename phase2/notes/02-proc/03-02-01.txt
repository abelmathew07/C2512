Yes, you can use the C++ Standard Library's ``std::mutex`` 
for synchronization in a multithreaded application. 
However, when it comes to `Inter-Process Communication (IPC)`, 
the C++ Standard Library's `std::mutex` 
is not directly suitable 
because it works only within a single process.

For IPC, 
you need a mutex 
that can be shared across processes. 

This typically requires operating system support, 
such as `POSIX mutexes` or 
platform-specific APIs.

`Why Can't `std::mutex` Be Used Directly in IPC?`
1. `std::mutex` instances are designed 
for thread synchronization within a single process.
2. They don't provide mechanisms 
for sharing across process boundaries 
(e.g., in shared memory).

`Alternative: POSIX Mutex with Shared Memory`
To achieve mutex-based synchronization across processes, 
you can use `POSIX mutexes` 
combined with shared memory, 
as shown in the previous example.

---

`When to Use `std::mutex``
- If your goal is `multithreading` within the same process, `std::mutex` (or its variants like `std::recursive_mutex` or `std::timed_mutex`) is a good choice.
- If you need `process-based communication (IPC)`, use POSIX mutexes with shared memory.

`Can I Use `std::mutex` with Shared Memory for IPC?`
In theory, you could map an `std::mutex` into shared memory, 
but this is not a supported or portable approach. 
The standard library does not guarantee compatibility 
for `std::mutex` instances across processes. 
Instead, itâ€™s better to use POSIX primitives 
designed explicitly for this purpose.

With `single process with threads`, we may an example using `std::mutex`. 
For `IPC`, stick with `POSIX shared mutexes`.
