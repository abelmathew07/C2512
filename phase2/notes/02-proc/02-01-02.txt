Below is the implementation of 
the `Producer-Consumer Model` using `fork()` 
for `inter-process communication (IPC)` 
with anonymous pipes in C++:

Updated Implementation
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <vector>

void producer(int write_fd) {
    // Producer generates data
    std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int value : data) {
        write(write_fd, &value, sizeof(value));
        std::cout << "Producer sent: " << value << std::endl;
    }
    // Signal end of data with a special value (-1)
    int end_signal = -1;
    write(write_fd, &end_signal, sizeof(end_signal));
    close(write_fd);
}

void consumer(int read_fd) {
    int value;
    while (read(read_fd, &value, sizeof(value)) > 0) {
        if (value == -1) {
            // End of data signal
            break;
        }
        std::cout << "Consumer received: " << value << std::endl;
    }
    close(read_fd);
}

int main() {
    int pipe_fds[2];
    if (pipe(pipe_fds) == -1) {
        perror("pipe");
        return 1;
    }

    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid < 0) {
        perror("fork");
        return 1;
    } else if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process: Consumer
        close(pipe_fds[1]); // Close unused write end
        consumer(pipe_fds[0]);
    } else {
        // Parent process: Producer
        close(pipe_fds[0]); // Close unused read end
        producer(pipe_fds[1]);

        // Wait for the child process to complete
        wait(nullptr);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation
1. `Anonymous Pipe`:
   - The `pipe()` system call creates a unidirectional communication channel with two ends:
     - `pipe_fds[0]`: Read end.
     - `pipe_fds[1]`: Write end.

2. `Fork`:
   - `fork()` creates a new child process.
   - The child process runs the `consumer()` function.
   - The parent process runs the `producer()` function.

3. `Producer`:
   - Writes data to the pipe.
   - Ends with a special value (`-1`) to signal the end of the data stream.

4. `Consumer`:
   - Reads data from the pipe.
   - Stops when it encounters the special value (`-1`).

5. `Synchronization`:
   - The `wait()` system call ensures that the parent process waits for the child process to complete.

Sample Output
```
Producer sent: 1
Producer sent: 2
Producer sent: 3
Producer sent: 4
Producer sent: 5
Consumer received: 1
Consumer received: 2
Consumer received: 3
Consumer received: 4
Consumer received: 5
```

Key Points
1. `IPC with Pipes`:
   - Anonymous pipes are suitable for parent-child communication.
   - Pipes are unidirectional; for bidirectional communication, you would need two pipes.

2. `Process Isolation`:
   - The producer and consumer run in separate memory spaces.

3. `Error Handling`:
   - The implementation includes basic error checking for `pipe()` and `fork()`.

=================================================================================

The provided code demonstrates a simple implementation of the `Producer-Consumer Model` using `anonymous pipes` and `fork()` for interprocess communication in C++. Below is a detailed walkthrough:

---

Key Components of the Code:

1. `Pipe Creation`:
   ```cpp
   int pipe_fds[2];
   if (pipe(pipe_fds) == -1) {
       perror("pipe");
       return 1;
   }
   ```
   - The `pipe()` system call creates a unidirectional communication channel. 
   - `pipe_fds[0]` is the `read end`.
   - `pipe_fds[1]` is the `write end`.

2. `Forking a Child Process`:
   ```cpp
   pid_t pid = fork();
   ```
   - The `fork()` system call creates a new child process.
   - The child process inherits the file descriptors of the parent process.

3. `Producer Function`:
   ```cpp
   void producer(int write_fd) {
       std::vector<int> data = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
       for (int value : data) {
           write(write_fd, &value, sizeof(value));
           std::cout << "Producer sent: " << value << std::endl;
       }
       int end_signal = -1;
       write(write_fd, &end_signal, sizeof(end_signal));
       close(write_fd);
   }
   ```
   - Writes a series of integers to the pipe.
   - Sends a special value (`-1`) to signal the end of data.
   - Closes the write end of the pipe after sending the data.

4. `Consumer Function`:
   ```cpp
   void consumer(int read_fd) {
       int value;
       while (read(read_fd, &value, sizeof(value)) > 0) {
           if (value == -1) break; // End of data signal
           std::cout << "Consumer received: " << value << std::endl;
       }
       close(read_fd);
   }
   ```
   - Reads integers from the pipe until it encounters the end signal (`-1`).
   - Closes the read end of the pipe after processing.

5. `Parent and Child Logic`:
   ```cpp
   if (pid == 0) {
       // Child process: Consumer
       close(pipe_fds[1]);
       consumer(pipe_fds[0]);
   } else {
       // Parent process: Producer
       close(pipe_fds[0]);
       producer(pipe_fds[1]);
       wait(nullptr);
   }
   ```
   - The parent process acts as the producer, writing to the pipe.
   - The child process acts as the consumer, reading from the pipe.
   - The parent waits for the child process to complete using `wait()`.

---

Expected Output:
The output will look like this:
```
Producer sent: 1
Producer sent: 2
Producer sent: 3
Producer sent: 4
Producer sent: 5
Consumer received: 1
Consumer received: 2
Consumer received: 3
Consumer received: 4
Consumer received: 5
```

---

Notes:
1. `Pipe Behavior`:
   - Pipes provide unidirectional communication. 
   - For bidirectional communication, two separate pipes would be needed.

2. `Synchronization`:
   - The `wait()` ensures that the producer (parent) does not terminate before the consumer (child) finishes.

3. `Error Handling`:
   - Proper error checking is in place for `pipe()` and `fork()`.

---

Extensions:
1. `Bidirectional Communication`:
   Implement another pipe for the child to send data back to the parent.

2. `Named Pipes (FIFOs)`:
   Use named pipes for communication between unrelated processes.

3. `Real-World Applications`:
   This code could be adapted for scenarios like:
   - ETL pipelines.
   - Data streaming between producer and consumer processes.
