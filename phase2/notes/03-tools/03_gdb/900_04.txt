The notes provided are quite comprehensive, 
covering everything 
from basic commands to advanced debugging techniques. 

However, there are a few additional `concepts and features of GDB` 
that could be helpful to include for a more thorough understanding:

---

`11. Conditional Execution`
1. `Run Program with Conditions`:  
   To run the program with a specific condition:
   ```bash
   (gdb) condition <breakpoint_number> <condition>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   (gdb) condition 1 x > 10
   ```

2. `Ignore Breakpoints Temporarily`:  
   Skip a breakpoint a certain number of times before stopping:
   ```bash
   (gdb) ignore <breakpoint_number> <count>
   ```

---

`12. Debugging C++ Specific Features`
1. `Handle Namespaces`:  
   Specify fully qualified names for functions or variables if you use namespaces:
   ```bash
   (gdb) break NamespaceName::FunctionName
   ```

2. `Inspect Classes and Objects`:  
   - Print a class or object's fields:
     ```bash
     (gdb) print object
     ```
   - Access specific fields in an object:
     ```bash
     (gdb) print object.field
     ```

3. `Virtual Functions`:  
   GDB can show which virtual function is being called:
   ```bash
   (gdb) set print vtbl on
   ```

---

`13. Automating with GDB`
1. `Command Files`:  
   Automate commands by placing them in a file and loading them:
   ```bash
   gdb -x commands.gdb ./my_program
   ```
   Example `commands.gdb`:
   ```gdb
   break main
   run
   backtrace
   ```

2. `Startup Script`:  
   Add custom GDB settings to `.gdbinit` in your home directory or project root:
   ```bash
   set pagination off
   set logging on
   ```

---

`14. Debugging Multithreaded Programs`
1. `Switch Threads`:  
   ```bash
   (gdb) thread <thread_number>
   ```

2. `Thread-specific Breakpoints`:  
   Set a breakpoint for a specific thread:
   ```bash
   (gdb) break <location> thread <thread_id>
   ```

3. `Check Mutex Locks`:  
   Use `info threads` to see the thread states and check for deadlocks.

---

`15. Debugging Signals`
1. `List All Signals`:  
   ```bash
   (gdb) info signals
   ```

2. `Handle a Specific Signal`:  
   Example for ignoring `SIGINT`:
   ```bash
   (gdb) handle SIGINT nostop noprint
   ```

---

`16. Debugging Forked Processes`
1. `Follow Child Process`:  
   By default, GDB debugs only the parent process. 
   To follow the child process:
   ```bash
   (gdb) set follow-fork-mode child
   ```

2. `Switch Between Parent and Child`:  
   If debugging both:
   ```bash
   (gdb) info inferiors
   (gdb) inferior <id>
   ```

---

`17. Reverse Debugging`
Some modern versions of GDB support reverse debugging, 
allowing you to step `backwards` through your program.  
1. `Enable Record Mode`:
   ```bash
   (gdb) target record
   ```
2. `Step Backwards`:
   ```bash
   (gdb) reverse-step
   (gdb) reverse-next
   ```

---

`18. Debugging Shared Libraries`
1. `Set Breakpoints in a Shared Library`:
   Load symbols for a shared library and set breakpoints:
   ```bash
   (gdb) sharedlibrary <library_name>
   ```
2. `Debug Loading of Libraries`:
   ```bash
   (gdb) set stop-on-solib-events 1
   ```

---

`19. Advanced Memory Debugging`
1. `Watch for Memory Access`:
   ```bash
   (gdb) watch *(int *)0xaddress
   ```
2. `Check for Memory Leaks`:  
   Use `valgrind` alongside GDB for in-depth analysis:
   ```bash
   valgrind --vgdb=yes --vgdb-error=0 ./my_program
   ```

---

`20. Python Scripting in GDB`
1. `Write Python Scripts for GDB`:
   Use Python to automate tasks:
   ```python
   class HelloWorldCommand(gdb.Command):
       def __init__(self):
           super(HelloWorldCommand, self).__init__("hello", gdb.COMMAND_USER)

       def invoke(self, args, from_tty):
           print("Hello, world!")

   HelloWorldCommand()
   ```
   Save the script as `hello.py` and load it:
   ```bash
   (gdb) source hello.py
   (gdb) hello
   ```

---

`21. Debugging Tips`
1. `Debugging Large Projects`:
   - Load only the required files using `set substitute-path`.
   - Use `break` or `step` to narrow down the issue.

2. `Analyze Core Dumps`:
   Ensure core dumps are enabled (`ulimit -c unlimited`) and 
   open them in GDB:
   ```bash
   gdb ./my_program core
   ```

Final Notes
These additions cover more niche but powerful features of GDB, 
like multithreading, reverse debugging, and automation, 
which are especially useful for complex C++ projects.
