When you run a program in `gdb` and see the prompt:

```plaintext
Enable debuginfod for this session? (y or [n])
```

This refers to `debuginfod`, 
a service that helps you retrieve 
    debug information files, 
    source code, and 
    binary files 
from a remote server.

`What is debuginfod?`
- `Debuginfod` is a part of the `elfutils` project.
- It allows `gdb` and other debugging tools to automatically fetch 
    debug symbols, 
    source code, and 
    binaries 
from a remote or 
local server 
    when they are missing on your system.

- This is particularly useful if:
  - You're debugging prebuilt binaries 
  (e.g., from a Linux distribution's package manager).
  - You don’t have the debug symbols installed locally.

---

`How does it work?`
- If enabled, `gdb` will query a `debuginfod server` 
to find the necessary debug symbols or source files.
- The server returns the required files, and 
gdb uses them for debugging.

---

`Benefits of debuginfod`
- Saves time: You don’t need to manually install debug symbol packages.
- Convenient: Useful for systems with shared binaries, such as containers or virtual machines.
- Transparent: Works in the background without needing additional user input.

---

`Why is it asking for your input?`
- By default, `debuginfod` is disabled to respect privacy and system settings.
- If enabled, `gdb` will send information about binaries you're debugging (like build IDs) to a debuginfod server.

---

`Options when prompted`
1. `Enable it (y)`: 
   - gdb will connect to a debuginfod server if needed.
   - May require an internet connection, depending on the server.

2. `Disable it ([n]):`
   - gdb will only use locally installed debug symbols.

3. `Configure globally:`
   - To avoid being prompted in the future:
     - Enable: 
       ```bash
       export DEBUGINFOD_URLS="https://debuginfod.server.url"
       ```
     - Disable:
       ```bash
       unset DEBUGINFOD_URLS
       ```

---

`When should you enable it?`
- `Enable it` if:
  - You're debugging system-installed binaries.
  - You don’t have debug symbol packages installed locally.
- `Disable it` if:
  - You're debugging your own programs with debug symbols already available.
  - You have privacy concerns or are working offline.
